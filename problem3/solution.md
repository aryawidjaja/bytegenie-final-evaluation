# Problem 3: Approach for Verifying and Improving LLM-Generated SQL Queries

To solve this problem, we can use an approach similar to what we did in Problem 2. First, the system should run the LLM-generated SQL query in a safe environment to check if it works without errors. Then, just like in Problem 2, we can compare the results of this query with expected results based on the logic we’ve already built. If the query results don’t match the expected data, the system can adjust the query step by step, filtering and refining the data like we did with the event, company, and people attributes in Problem 2. This way, the system ensures that the query not only runs correctly but also returns the most accurate and relevant data. By using this method, we can make sure the SQL query is as close to perfect as possible before sending the final answer to the user.
